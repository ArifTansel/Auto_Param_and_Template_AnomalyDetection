# Graph_AnomalyDetection
Anomaly Detection with Graph data structure. Then correction with LLM 
Anomaly detection with BLISTM  model.  Using log template and params automatically. 

- Template extraction with Drain3
- Param extraction with LLM models 
- Embedding Template and Params 
- Train and Test Dataset 
- Explanation of anomalies which param is wrong

Inspired by [**TPLogAD: Unsupervised Log Anomaly Detection Based on Event Templates and Key Parameters**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15250)

Can try it with : [**Logpai Loghub HDFS logs**](https://github.com/logpai/loghub?tab=readme-ov-file)
